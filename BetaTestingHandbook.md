## Testing Guidelines

**The following items should be reported in our feedback form,**

- Visual bugs, anomalies, or anything that doesn't make sense in the app interface.
- Generated routes that are not viewable, unreasonable, broken, and (if you're familiar with Berkeley) unsafe.

**While testing, you can try to**

1. Use the app like you would if you were a regular user.
    1. Search for places you normally visit.
    2. Try different safety settings (which you can change by tapping the gear icon on the top right corner).
    3. Try generating routes in Berkeley with Stroll and walk there.
2. Go wild and try to break the app with unexpected edge cases.

**When walking with Stroll,**

You should still be street smart, travel when it's safe, and be aware of your surroundings! Stroll isn't Batman.
